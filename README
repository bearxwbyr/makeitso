This very simple framework enables a collection of tasks to be defined as methods on a PHP class, and configuration values to be defined in a XML file. The tasks then have easy access to the configuration values as instance variables (declared or dynamic) or via XPath.




To install, install like eg. on MacOS :

sudo pear install http://github.com/buzzware/makeitso/raw/master/releases/makeitso-0.0.1.tgz

You'll need to adjust the version by referring to http://github.com/buzzware/makeitso/tree/master/releases/
